# Calling Google Drive API with Service Account

This example shows the process for accessing Google APIs via a service account, abstracting the Google Drive API `/files` endpoint. Covered in this demo are signing JSON Web Tokens (RSA), exchanging the JWT for an Access Token, and storing that access token in ObjectStore. These token flows are accessed via the header configured in the HTTP Request config.
